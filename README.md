glShadows
=========

OpenGL 2D normal map / shadow casting demo based loosely on https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics/wiki/ShaderLesson6
This is my CS 419 Shaders final project, and contains some really hacky code, but the shaders are relatively sane.

Uses some art from OpenGameArt, and (todo: some other free texture I found, find where I found it.)
L to add a light that's a clone of the one under the mouse.
Up, Down to move the mouse light's z value
Left, Right to change the light's radius multiplier (beware: strange effects can happen)
Press R to randomize light color for the mouse light
Q,W, A,S, Z,X to change constant linear quadratic falloff. for the mouse light
